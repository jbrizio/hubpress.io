= Trigger click when determinate requests finish using AngularJS

One of the last projects where I collaborate, the requirement has specifically triggered a click in one element of the DOM when determinate requests finish.

After of make a deep research about some solutions and try some of these, the final solution results on apply the $broadcast event on the functions declared and use a counter to validate the last cycle of the calls to trigger the click on the element.

The best way to understand how was implemented this is through the following example:

```
// Here we declare an empty array to store each request
var requests = [];

// Our first function
$scope.firstFunction = function() {
    // Execute broadcast event with the name of the function
    $scope.$broadcast('requestEnded', requests.push('firstFunction'));
};

// Our last function
$scope.secondFunction = function() {
    // Execute broadcast event with the name of the function
    $scope.$broadcast('requestEnded', requests.push('secondFunction'));
};

// This listener is executed each time that requestEnded is fired
$scope.$on('requestEnded', function(event, countRequests) {
    // Here we validate that the count of requests is the desire
    if (countRequests == 2) {
        // Trigger Click
        $('.class-selector').click();
    }
});
```
