:hp-alt-title: Save time at diary automating recurring tasks

Itâ€™s always fascinating to see how much of the tasks that you do at diary can be automated. In my case, how to a developer at diary I write repetitive commands in my terminal. The most commons are:

- Transpile code
- Manage local server
- Connect to the VPN
- View logs

I always recommend to my co-workers create an alias when you write repetitive commands. This is much easier to remind and you save a lot of time at the end of the day.

== Uses for aliases
There are several types of uses for aliases. They include:

- Reducing the amount of typing that is necessary for commands
- Correcting common misspellings of commands
- Standardizing the name of a command across multiple OS

== Improving your knowledge
If you feel confident with the command-line, I recommend reading the entire guide of Joshua Levy. This is a great selection of notes and tips on using the command-line: https://github.com/jlevy/the-art-of-command-line
